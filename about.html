               I'm a software engineer in Atlanta, Georgia. My interests are mobile, machine learning, 
               and human-computer interaction.
               
               I spent three years working for a <a href="http://vocalocity.com">VoIP startup</a> and learned a lot about how hard it is making
               reliable software.
             </p>
             <p>
               I graduated from Georgia Tech with degrees in Chemistry and Computer Science. In between I worked as a
               researcher at <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/pulsenet/">PulseNet in the Centers for Disease Control</a>.
             </p>
             <p>
               For fun I like to race track bikes.

               Do you like Huey Lewis and the News? Their early work was a little too new wave for my tastes, but when Sports 
               came out in '83, I think they really came into their own, commercially and artistically. The whole album has a 
               clear, crisp sound, and a new sheen of consummate professionalism that really gives the songs a big boost. 
               He's been compared to Elvis Costello, but I think Huey has a far much more bitter, cynical sense of humor. 
               In '87, Huey released this, Fore, their most accomplished album. I think their undisputed masterpiece is Hip to 
               be Square, a song so catchy, most people probably don't listen to the lyrics. But they should, because it's 
               not just about the pleasures of conformity, and the importance of trends, it's also a personal statement about 
               the band itself.
