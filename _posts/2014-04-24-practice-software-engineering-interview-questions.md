# Practice Software Engineering Interview Questions

Here are some small, simple software engineering interview questions
I've collected. I've been getting a lot of requests for them of late
so I figured I'd do everyone a favor and put them all in one place. I
hope they do people some good.

If you're curious to see answers to any of these in Java, [send me an
email](mailto:erik@tense.io). I'm not posting them publicly to keep
everyone honest.
