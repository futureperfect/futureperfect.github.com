I went to a really interesting talk about IBMâ€™s Watson by Bill
Murdock, a member of the Algorithms team (and fellow Georgia Tech
alum). The room was one of the largest lecture rooms the College of
Computing has access to and the interest was well beyond capacity.
Here are some notes I took of his presentation for those of you who
were unable to attend. He gave a pretty good explanation of some of
the more egregious snafus that happened during the course of the
tournament, including the Final Jeopardy question where it seemed to
indicate that it thought Toronto was a city in the US.

I think I was most surprised in the end by how much of Watson was
based on statistical reasoning over unstructured text documents, given
the problem domain naturally lends it self to symbolic reasoning and
inference techniques.
