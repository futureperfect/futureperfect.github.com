I'm a software engineer located in Seattle, Washington. I have experience with
web service engineering and mobile application development (primarily iOS).
My education and interests include user experience, algorithms, and machine
learning. In a past life I was [pretty decent at polymer chemistry](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15754386)
